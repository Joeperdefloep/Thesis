Perspectives on Science
-----------------------

An attempt will be made to use modeling tools that have been proven to
be effective in broad contexts (universal validity), but because of the
wide range of socioeconomic and climatic conditions, these will have to
be adapted to local conditions (context specific). Since the envisioned
platform allows for bottom-up knowledge construction, allowing for
different ontologies, that can be part of the evaluation of the
platform, but are not part of the initial development and study.

Since we are operating on an area that has multiple stakeholders and
interests, the constructed knowledge and causality will not be
objectively verifiable, but rather a combination of established
(positivist) and socially constructed forms of knowledge. As such, it
will mostly be a bottom-up 'policy' study.

Cross-disciplinarity
--------------------

Since my main strengths lie in modeling, I think I will focus on the
development of the platform, and its associated technical challenges.
However, I will also communicate with the stakeholders, and attempt to
cooperate with students and academics from different disciplines for
guidance on those aspects of the study. This will be a
inter-disciplinary approach, since I incorporate different disciplines
myself. The inter-disciplinary nature will come from the interaction
with farmers, and semi-structured interviews during evaluation of the
platform.
