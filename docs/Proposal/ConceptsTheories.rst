Concepts and theories

My involvement in the game will revolve around Sustainable Land
Management practices. Sustainable land management is a concept that
places land use in a broader context, with the aim of achieving
sustainable development. Sustainable development is defined as
development that *meets the needs of the present without impacting the
ability to meet those needs in the future* by the UN. This is also the
definition I will be using. Then, sustainable land *management* places
this sustainability in a broader societal context, where multiple
stakeholders are involved. Thus, sustainability is achieved
socio-economically, as well as environmentally. Sustainable land
management *practices* are the practices that help a farmer establish
sustainable land management. For example building terraces to prevent
erosion and using manure to prevent nutrient depletion.

One concept that is personally important to me is the concept of Open
Science. This is a relatively new concept, successfully used by
:xcite:`[@WoelfleOpenScienceResearch2011]`. It is a form of
science, which applies the principles of open source software to
science. In open source software, the source code is openly shared, and
everybody can contribute, based on their interest. Notable examples of
open knowledge are Wikipedia and the various StackExchange websites. In
:xcite:`[@WeberSuccessOpenSource2009]`, the concept of open
source is thoroughly analyzed, including how it is ideologically
fundamentally different from Intellectual Property-based, commercial
software development. An important note is that open source software is
largely created by its users, and as such inverts Conway's law: that a
technology reflects the organizational structure of its developers.
Analogously, classical science reflects university structure rather than
serving the needs of farmers. In an open science context, knowledge is
created [2]_ by farmers rather than by the researcher. However, given
the limited time in a thesis project and the lack of infrastructure to
facilitate such knowledge construction, concessions have to be made. My
third sub-research question is associated with this concept.

Another big concept is Soil Fertility. In literature, it is often used
without definition. However,
:xcite:`[@MaederSoilFertilityBiodiversity2002]`, defined a
fertile soil as providing essential nutrients for crop plant growth,
supporting a diverse and active biotic community and allowing for an
undisturbed decomposition.
:xcite:`[@SanchezSoilFertilityHunger2002]` does not give a
definition of fertility, but rather discusses soil nutrient depletion
that is ubiquitous in sub-saharan africa, combined with farmer-developed
strategies for increasing their yields.
:xcite:`[@TiessenRoleSoilOrganic1994b]` pose that organic
matter has a big influence on soil fertility, especially in
(sub)tropical regions, where slow decomposition of organic matter allows
for better nutrient uptake than artificial fertilizers. However, it also
leads to soil degradation with loss of organic matter, which it argues
is often overlooked. As such, I define soil fertility as an aggregate of
many biophysical factors that together determine how much a crop grows.
It includes nutrient and water availability, aeration, (biological) pest
control and other factors. Dependent on these, the different crops will
have a different yield gap, because some crops favour different
conditions. However, for the player of the game, the impact of SLM
measures on all of these factors on different crops would be very
difficult to track. Therefore, they are aggregated into fertility. This
approach closely resembles the approach taken by SEGAE. The structure of
SEGAE is shown in figure `1 <#fig:segae>`__. Quantitatively, soil
fertility is a number (percentage) that reduces the yield based on
available nutrients and water.

Knowledge construction is the process of learning, from a constructivist
perspective. In education, this is opposed to behaviorism and
cognitivsim. Constructivism takes the notion that different words have
different meanings to different individuals. Therefore, when an
individual learns something (from someone else), they construct that
knowledge, based on their relationship with what they learn
:xcite:`[@Ertmer1993]`. For example, when I explain erosion
to a farmer, I would think about the stream power law and fluxes,
whereas a farmer thinks about gullying, exposed roots and reduced yield.
When a farmer would communicate this to another farmer, the learning
process is enhanced, because their worlds show more overlap. Therefore,
farmer-to-farmer knowledge construction is more effective.

Lastly, farmer motivation is another difficult concept. Farmer
motivation is often not purely economical, but intrinsic in nature
:xcite:`[@GassonGoalsValuesFarmers1973]`. In my research, I
postulate that this is hindered by a lack of perspective and reducing
yields. This results in a decreasing hope of the farmer and
subsequently, their willingness to experiment with new measures. A
motivated farmer wants to work on the land from intrinsic motivation,
has a good perceived future perspective, and is willing to share their
knowledge, skills and enthusiasm to interested people.

   Knowledge creation defined by
   :xcite:`[@NonakaKnowledgeCreatingTheoryRevisited2015]` is
   a concept describing how knowledge is created within a firm by
   analyzing contradictory views of different individuals, as opposed to
   knowledge construction, defined later.
