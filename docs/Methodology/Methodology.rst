Methodologies
=============

.. _RQ1:

How can SLM practices be incorporated into current development of the AHF?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For research question :ref:`1<RQ1>`, I will take a participatory
approach and engage with the development of Famz2U. Farmz2U closely
works together with farmers, and we will select a group of 5=10 farmers
of similar size under similar conditions. Together with them, I will
develop a minimal working module on soil conservation, that fits within
the new Highland Farmer Game. The implementation will be based on
literature research, while the direction of development and measures
will depend on the conditions of the group of pilot farmers.

.. _RQ2:

What curriculum will contribute to awareness raising about Soil and Water Conservation measures in high school students in the Netherlands?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondly, when the game is working, research question :ref:`2<RQ2>`
will be addressed. For that, another similar group of farmers will be
selected using snowball sampling. With this group of farmers, I will
conduct semi=structured interviews about how they manage their land.
After that, I will let them play the game, and discuss how their views
on Sustainable land management have changed. Furthermore, players of the
game will be prompted with opt=in participation in a questionnaire
before and after playing the game. This form of convenience sampling
will provide closed interviews for quantitative analysis. Using data
from both the semi=structured interviews and questionnaires, I will
answer research question :ref:`2<RQ2>`.

.. _RQ3:

What are socio-cultural or socio-economic factors that influence the effecicacy of the curriculum for awareness raising?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, during the semi=structured interviews, I will also address
research question :ref:`3<RQ3>` with the farmers. Based on their
responses, I will conduct interviews with Farmz2U employees and relevant
academics. Based on this, as well as my inside knowledge of the AHF, I
will answer research question 3.
